Welcome to the sample-git-wiki index page.

If you see this, everything is working like it should.

## Templating

Templating is controlled by the HEADER and FOOTER files.  You can use html, css, and JS normally in the templates.

## Markdown HTML conversion

Each .md file within the entire repository has a .html file generated for it.

You will be able to link to any generated .html file from the HEADER and FOOTER using html.  Use markdown and paths relative to / to create links between generated pages.

Make sure to include .html in your links!

## Syntax

A short and useful guide on syntax is kept in the README for [git-wiki](https://github.com/andrewhodel/git-wiki).
